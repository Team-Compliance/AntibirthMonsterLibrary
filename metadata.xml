    <description>This is a Library in which other modders can freely use Antibirth Enemies for their mods. This mod does nothing by itself, it relies on players downloading other mods that are compatible with this one (Check out the collection at the top of the page for mods that incorporate the Library). If you make a mod that uses this, then please tell us in the comments or in our Discord server so that we can add it to the compatibility collection.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/3WOC9V0.png[/img] [u]𝐃𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠[/u]: Round enemies that fly around aimlessly and fart. They fart whenever Isaac gets close, upon taking damage, and upon death. Farts knock Isaac back and propel it forwards. 

[img]https://i.imgur.com/05KJjIh.png[/img] [u]𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠[/u]: A pale variant of Dumplings. They behave similarly, but their farts are poisonous and can damage Isaac.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/HLPq5yu.png[/img] [u]𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐛[/u]: A bloody variant of Dumplings that actively chase Isaac. They easily catch up to him by making quick, rapid dashes in his direction. When attacked, they fart, shoot 6 blood shots in all directions, and fly off in a random direction. Upon death they again fart and release 6 blood shots in all directions.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/hvjBv07.png[/img] [u]𝐂𝐨𝐢𝐥[/u]: Indestructible spinal cord enemies found commonly in the Corpse chapter. They are immobile but can zap a constant laser at all enemies in the room (except for other Coils).

[img]https://i.imgur.com/S7RSHI8.png[/img] [u]𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐍𝐓[/u]: Red TNT barrels explode when destroyed. Unlike regular TNT barrels, red TNT only needs to be shot once to be detonated. They also detonate if Isaac or an enemy walks into it.
